# Interested in learning Python this summer?

ðŸ“– With limited slots, I'm offering a **1-on-1 Introduction to Python** course this summer.

âœ¨ Learn everything you need to get a solid footing with modern Python. 

ðŸ”­ Intended for those with little-to-no programming experience, we'll start with a general overview of the language, touch on key topics, then dive in from the ground up.

ðŸš€ You'll be guided through a curriculum I designed, intended to flex the strength of Python as a general purpose language. Before you can learn machine learning, or write your first robotrader, you've got to understand how the pieces come together. I can help give you that starting boost.

Note: The first couple of sessions will be free, and the few after that at a reduced rate. This disclaimer will be removed when I'm comfortable charging people the full price, which is still being determined.
