# Mindfulness: redefining the end goal ðŸ§˜
You have heard all of the *magical thinking* that comes along with mindfulness. These supernatural claims can (understandably) turn skeptics off of the idea. Today I'd like explain my personal take on mindfulness, avoiding any grandiose nonsense. 

## What is mindfulness?
A helpful way to explain mindfulness is to explain it's counterpart, mindlessness. To be **mindless** is to walk through your day on autopilot, letting your emotions dictate your mood and aspirations. Unfortunately for you and me, this is the default state we operate in. To be mindful is to consciously break out of this mindless trance, making purposeful and rational decisions.

## How do you practice being mindful?
**Meditation**! *Meditation* is quiet time for your brain. Instead of generating new thoughts, or pondering over old ones, you simply intake your environment. Observe the thoughts that enter your mind, and practice not engaging with them. Remember, you can't turn your brain off, but you can disengage from the worries it's trying to remind you of. 

### I thought meditation was sitting quiet, chanting? / I thought mediation was religious or spiritual?
It absolutely can be. Ultimately meditation is being mindful of your thoughts and actions. You can do this quietly on a pillow, or while pulling weeds in your garden. 

## "I've tried meditating. It's boring and ineffective"
I was shocked too by how dull the idea is in practice. Shockingly, your brain hates being bored. Who knew? That's the sort of "pain" that is needed for real personal growth. Similarly to exercise, it's really uncomfortable starting out. But unlike exercise, your load doesn't get harder, but easier.

## If it's admittedly dull, how could I possibly benefit?
You quickly get to know yourself during these meditation sessions.

You'll learn...
* How quickly you need stimulus, like YouTube or twitter
* What your brain's default state is
* How often you think of the past or future
* How runaway thoughts snowball into bad days

In time you'll recognize these mental pitfalls and how capable you are of overcoming them. 

## Conclusion
Mindfulness is operating purposefully and consciously, both physically and mentally.

You can practice being mindful with meditation, the practice of observing your thoughts/environment passively, to see what comes of them.

You can be mindful in your day to day tasks, by taking your time and consciously making decisions.

## Tips for meditation
* Practice "active" meditation during your daily chores, like folding the laundry or doing the dishes.
* Practice "traditional" meditation daily, by finding a quiet space and observing your thoughts. (Why am I relaxed? Why am I stressed? Why am I hot? How does the room smell? How does the wind sound against my ears?)
* Pick a frequent occurrences (washing your hands, starting your car) to tie your practice to. For example, anytime I'm washing my hands I'm taking a second to stop thinking about my day and solely focus on washing my hands. You'll begin to notice how impactful these pauses can be
* Read, read, read! There's lot of wonderful (secular, science based) books that take a deep dive into the lasting impact of mindfulness. But be careful! There's a lot of nonsense out there. Avoid sensational titles and seek out well researched books written by psychologist, psychiatrist, etc. Most gurus are filled to the brim with baloney.
