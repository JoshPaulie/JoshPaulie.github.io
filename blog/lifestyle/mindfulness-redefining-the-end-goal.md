# Mindfulness: redefining the end goal ðŸ§˜
You have heard all of the *magical thinking* that comes along with mindfulness. These supernatural claims can (understandably) turn skeptics off of the idea. Today I'd like explain my personal take on mindfulness, avoiding any grandiose nonsense. 

## What is mindfulness?
A helpful way to explain mindfulness is to explain it's counterpart, mindlessness. To be **mindless** is to walk through your day on autopilot, letting your emotions dictate your mood and aspirations. Unfortunately for you and me, this is the default state we operate in. To be mindful is to consciously break out of this mindless trance, making purposeful and rational decisions.

## How do you practice being mindful?
**Meditation**! *Meditation* is quiet time for your brain. Instead of generating new thoughts, or pondering over old ones, you simply intake your environment. Observe the thoughts that enter your mind, and practice not engaging with them. Remember, you can't turn your brain off, but you can disengage from the worries it's trying to remind you of. 

### I thought meditation was sitting quiet, chanting? / I thought mediation was religious or spiritual?
It absolutely can be. Ultimately meditation is being mindful of your thoughts and actions. You can do this quietly on a pillow, or while pulling weeds in your garden. 

## I've tried meditating. It's boring and ineffective
I was shocked too by how dull the idea is in practice. Shockingly, your brain hates being bored. Who knew? That's the sort of "pain" that is needed for real personal growth. Similarly to exercise, it's really uncomfortable starting out. But unlike exercise, your load doesn't get harder, but easier.

## If it's admittedly dull, how could I possibly benefit?
You quickly get to know yourself during these meditation sessions.

You'll learn...
* How quickly you need stimulus, like YouTube or twitter
* What your brains default state is
* How often you think of the past or future

In time you'll recognize these mental pitfalls and how capable you are of overcoming them. You'll learn how runaway thoughts snowball into bad days, and how often you default to "oh shit! I'm screwed!"
